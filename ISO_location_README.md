### Overview
This is the reference environment for the manuscript ['Effects of Heterogeneous Organization of RyR Clusters, Myofibrils and Mitochondria on Ca 2+ Release Patterns in Cardiomyocytes'](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004417).  It executes code to reproduce specific results described in the manuscript.   You can find more information about this research at the [project page here](https://github.com/vraj004/RyR-simulator).

### Instructions for use

This version of the reference environment is a live image as a bootable read-only ISO.  To use it:

- Install a virtualization tool like [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), then 
- Create a new virtual machine in the virtualization tool with a virtual CD/DVD-ROM drive
- Mount the ISO in the drive
- Boot the machine.  

This will start a virtual machine with scripts to run which reproduce results described in the manuscript.
