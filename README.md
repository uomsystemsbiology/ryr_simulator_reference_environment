### Overview

This is the reference environment for the manuscript ['Effects of Heterogeneous Organization of RyR Clusters, Myofibrils and Mitochondria on Ca 2+ Release Patterns in Cardiomyocytes'](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004417).  It executes code to reproduce specific results described in the manuscript.   You can find more information about this research at the [project page here](https://github.com/vraj004/RyR-simulator).

### Instructions for use

This version of the reference environment is a virtual machine managed by [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com).  To use it, install [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), then do:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/uomsystemsbiology/ryr_simulator_reference_environment.git
$ cd ryr_simulator_reference_environment
$ vagrant up
$ vagrant reload
```
This will start a virtual machine with scripts to run which reproduce results described in the manuscript.
